# RunPETest

## Overview
RunPETest is a project designed to inject and run a PE (Portable Executable) file within another process. This technique is used for executing code within the context of another process, which can be useful for debugging, reverse engineering, or other advanced software manipulation tasks.

## Features
- Process creation and manipulation
- Memory allocation and writing PE image to the target process
- Setting up the context for the new process
